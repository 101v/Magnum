# Channels
## Overview
Channels allow messages to be sent to consumers. The are analogous to the Data Type Channel as defined in the [Enterprise Integration Patterns](http://www.integrationpatterns.com) book.

Channels are just one of the building blocks for creating classes that respond to messages sent by other objects. They are the input port of an object.
